# Codes for the paper: 'Thick Disks around White Dwarfs viewed "Edge-odd": Effects on Transit Properties and Infrared Excess' by Bhattacharjee 2025.

modeling_transits.ipynb : This notebook contains the codes for the thick disk transit model developed in Section 2 and reproduces the plots in paper.

near_infrared_emission : This notebook contains the codes for the infrared emission calculations described in Section 3 and reproduces the plots in paper.

Comments on the codes, their performance, and suggestion for any improvements are welcome! If you are using (part of) these codes in your work, kindly cite the paper linked above. Any changes/corrections in the codes are welcome. If done so, the lead author of the paper would appreciate if contacted and informed (contact information below). Significant improvements can also be incorporated in the codes and the model can be made better.
